# Using CSC Environment Efficiently

# Note! This repository is a work in progress

## Opening target is Q1 2021

This repository holds the source for the lectures, tutorials and exercises
for facilitating the efficient use of the CSC computational resources.
The content is designed as modular blocks that can be easily embedded
in training materials in universities, CSC's own training events or
any courses which touch topics where CSC resources can be used.

You are welcome to contribute to the content via fork and pull request!

The structure of the site has folders which typically contain three
subdirectories for

- slides (presenting the topic)
- tutorials (copy/paste walkthrough)
- exercises (tasks with instructions themed by scientific disciplines)
