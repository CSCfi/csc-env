# Logging in CSC Computers {.title}

In this section, you will learn how to login on CSC supercomputers with ssh and NoMachine.

# Log in with SSH

- SSH is a terminal program that will give you access to the command line on the CSC supercomputer
- It is the versatile main interface to a supercomputer
- Please read this page for an introduction on how to login with ssh: https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/
- Note the [prerequisites to be able to access Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-get-puhti-access/)

# Log in via NoMachine

- NoMachine is a software that makes remote graphics easier, like running a graphical version of the R software.
- NoMachine client must be installed locally on your computer first (May require admin privileges).
- [The client is used to connect to a server in Kajaani](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/nomachine/) and it provides faster graphical performance than X11-forwarding
- Please first consult the [Instructions on how to install and to use NoMachine](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/nomachine-usage/)

# Advanced topic: Setting up SSH-keys

- Using SSH-keys is easier and safer than using password with every login.
- SSH-keys can be easily used in Windows, Macs, Linux
- Consult our [tutorials on how to set up SSH-keys for your account](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/#setting-up-ssh-keys)
