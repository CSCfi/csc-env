# Installing own software {.title}

In this section you will learn about installing your own software on CSC servers.

# Code categories
- It is possible to install software on CSC servers
- Start by reading the software documentation
- Check the installation instructions to check the code type
  - Installation method depends on code type

# Binares
- If you have ready made binaries, you can just try to run them
- Problem with ready made binaries is that they are hardly ever optimal for the computer they are used on
  - Especially MPI codes should always be re-compiled
- Ready binaries should be considered if
  - Source code not available
  - Software is compiled on identical computer 
  - Software is for relatively light (serial or threaded) computation

# Interpreted languages
- Code written in a High-level interpreted languages
  -  Python, Java, Perl, R etc. 
- These languages do not need to be compiled, but they often can be. 
- These languages are often quite easy and efficient to get a program to do what it should, but for very extensive computations they are rarely optimal (and can easily be very far from optimal). 
- An efficient code should be constructed so that heavy computations utilize category 3) programming languages

# High-Performance-Computing languages
- Programming languages that needs compiler (C,C++,Fortran). 
  - This is tricky but should be used for heavy high-performance computing.

# Basic requirements
- You need a computer with a decent internet connection
- You need a CSC account and need to be part of a project: https://research.csc.fi/accounts-and-projects
- Log in to a CSC computer: https://docs.csc.fi/computing/connecting/
- You need to know, at least basic, Unix line commands:

# Instructions
- See tutorials for each category for more detailed instructions
 - Interpreted languages (link)
 - High-Performance-Computing languages (link)

 # Testing
- Construct a batch script
- Make a short and simple test run
  - Use known test data, e.g. test data provided by developer 
- Run test in the `test` queue or if really short and on single core â€“ just run the code on command line
