# Batch job tutorial

- In this tutorial we'll get familiar with the basic usage of the Slurm batch queue system at CSC
- The goal is to learn how to request resources that **match** the needs of a job  
- A job consists of two parts: resource requests and the job step(s)
- We'll go through examples for serial, parallel and interactive jobs
- Examples are done on Puhti
